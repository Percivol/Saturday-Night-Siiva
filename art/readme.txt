    WHAT ELSE IS THERE?

I can already hear you asking "does this mod do anything other than just slap a bunch of songs together?" and the answer is yes!
Here is a list of improvements that you wouldn't have over downloading the individual mods:

-Various custom sprites no longer overwrite the sprites for all songs (custom notes, for example) (trust me this is harder than it sounds)
-the songs are all sorted by week in story mode for your convenience
-one bonus song that i coded and charted myself, which isn't actually a SiIvagunner mod (although it is a song from their channel)
